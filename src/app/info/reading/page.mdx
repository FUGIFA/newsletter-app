# Reading Posts

Discover how readers can browse and view published newsletter posts.

## Public Post View

The reading experience is designed for newsletter subscribers and casual visitors to browse published content in a clean, accessible format.

### Accessing Posts

Navigate to the **Posts** section from the main navigation or visit `/posts` directly.

## Design System

### Visual Elements
- **Mantine Components**: Built with Mantine UI for consistency
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped styling for post cards
- **Theme Support**: Dark and light mode compatibility

### Layout Structure
```
Posts Page Layout:

## Content Filtering

### Published Posts Only
- Only posts with `published: true` are displayed
- Draft posts are hidden from public view
- Scheduled posts appear only after their publish time

### Database Query
The posts page uses an optimized Prisma query:
```typescript
const posts = await prisma.post.findMany({
  where: { published: true }
});
```

## Future Enhancements
